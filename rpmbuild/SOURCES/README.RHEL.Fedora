Notes for Spamassassin for RHEL or Fedora
=========================================
spamassassin-3.3.x RPM package for RHEL 5+ or Fedora 11+ contains some new 
functionality beyond the upstream spamassassin documentation.

Upstream spamassassin-3.3.0 is no longer distributed with rules.  Our package 
contains rules in order to be less of a surprise to system administrators.
However just as you wouldn't rely on antivirus software without signature
updates, spamassassin cannot be relied upon without regular rule updates.

1) For these reasons, our RPM package now runs nightly sa-update by default.

/etc/cron.d/sa-update
The default cron runs sa-update once every night.  You may edit this cron 
file to change the schedule of sa-update or to disable it entirely.  If you 
had modified this file in the past you may need to restore the new file 
from /etc/cron.d/sa-update.rpmnew

2) /usr/share/spamassassin/sa-update.cron
This script is executed by cron.  It runs sa-update only if a known spam 
daemon is running: spamd, amavisd, or mimedefang.  If you do not run any
of these spam daemons but wish to have nightly sa-update, you may 
override the daemon check in /etc/sysconfig/sa-update

3) /etc/mail/spamassassin/channel.d
All sa-update channels are defined in files contained in this directory.
See the existing config files as examples for writing your own config file.

General Warnings
================
* DO NOT USE SARE or OpenProtect rules.  They are old and outdated, and
  can be dangerous.  Many of the useful rules have been integrated into
  upstream spamassassin.

Note about -d option
====================

With spamassassin 3.4.0, this package has switched the way spamd is started. 
You should no longer use the '-d' option in /etc/sysconfig/spamassassin. Doing 
so will result in spamd starting and stopping in a loop. The default 
/etc/sysconfig/spamassassin file has been adjusted for this, please merge 
this change into that file if you have made any changes to it.
