# Default aliases file for postfix
#
# this file should be in /etc or in /etc/postfix but if you want it in
# /etc/postfix you'll have to adjust your /etc/postfix/main.cf file accordingly
#
# Aliases in this file will NOT be expanded in the header from
# mail, but WILL be visible over networks or from /bin/mail.
#
# Following alias is required by the mail protocol, RFC 822 (and by RFC2142)
# Set it to the address of a HUMAN who deals with this system's mail problems.

# ensure that the root alias is aliased to a HUMAN user, as otherwise
# mail may get delivered to the $default_privs user (nobody).

# CHANGE THIS LINE to an account of a HUMAN
root:		postfix

# Note to the user: You must create the alias above!
# The root alias *must* exist under postfix because
# postfix runs as a non-privileged user and cannot
# touch a spool file which is UID/GID root
# The mapping to the postfix user is to ensure that root's mail
# doesn't get lost on a system installed out of the box.
